  Scenario Outline: GET close approach data -- @1.1                                                          # features/get_test.feature:9
    Given I send the parameters "2021-01-01","2023-01-01","0","0.2" to get the close approach data for "443" # features/steps/get_distance_api.py:13
    Then I verify the response                                                                               # features/steps/get_distance_api.py:30
    And I verify the data contains                                                                           # features/steps/get_distance_api.py:39
